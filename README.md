# gurgle

A stream library.

## Really? Why?

On a recent project, I wanted to use RxJS to avoid what would otherwise have become a minefield of filthy state management and complex conditionals. Instead, I wondered into a minefield of FRP ideology and bad documentation. RxJS looks great and I think I'm going to be friends with it one day, but right now I need something a little leaner and more hackable.

It's a toy library in other words, built for a single project. Don't use it.
